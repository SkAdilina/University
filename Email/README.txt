This is a small project that I did for my Artificial Intelligence course in my 3rd year.

Project:
- Enter any sentence/text of any length.
- Click "Spam or not?" button.
- Pop up message to show whether the text is a spam or not.

The code can:
- Read 2 different files Spam.txt and Not Spam.txt. (As the name suggests the Spam.txt and Not Spam.txt contain all emails that are spam and not spam respectively)
- Read files of any length
